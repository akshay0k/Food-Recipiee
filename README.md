Sure! Here's a sample README format for a food recipe application using the Edamam API in React.js with TypeScript for the design part using Tailwind CSS and Vite:

# Food Recipe Application

- Filter recipes by various criteria such as dietary restrictions, cuisine, and meal type.
- View detailed information about each recipe, including ingredients and instructions.
- Save favorite recipes for quick access.
- Responsive design for a seamless experience on different devices.
